    T H E   P U G N A C I O U S   O R C
    ===================================

    After a drunken night out with friends, you awaken the
    next morning in a thick, dank forest. Head spinning and
    fighting the urge to vomit, you stand and marvel at
    your new, unfamiliar setting. The peace quickly fades
    when you hear a grotesque sound emitting behind you. A
    slobbering pugnacious orc is running towards you.

    What do you do?
  options:
    - text: Grab a nearby rock and throw it at the orc
      target: rock
    - text: Lie down and wait to be mauled
      target: lie
    - text: Run
      target: run

cave:
  statement: |
    You were hesitant, since the cave was dark and ominous.
    Before you fully enter, you notice a shiny sword on the
    ground.

    Do you pick up the sword?
  options:
    - text: yes
      target: next_with_sword
    - text: no
      target: next_without_sword
  points: 5

fight:
  statement: |
    You're no match for an orc.

    You died!

fight_with_sword:
  statement: |
    You laid in wait. The shimmering sword attracted the
    orc, which thought you were no match. As he walked
    closer and closer, your heart beat rapidly. As the orc
    reached out to grab the sword, you pierced the blade
    into its chest.

    You survived!
  points: 100

    You should have picked up that sword. You're
    defenseless.

  statement: |
    You're easily spotted.

    You died!

hide_in_cave:
  statement: |
    Really? You're going to hide in the dark? I think orcs
    can see very well in the dark, right? Not sure, but I'm
    going with YES, so...

    You died!

lie:
  statement: |
    Welp, that was quick.

    You died!

rock:

      target: run
    - text: Throw another rock
      target: rock_again
    - text: Go to a nearby cave
      target: cave
  points: 10

rock_again:
  statement: |
    You decided to throw another rock, as if the first
    rock thrown did much damage. The rock flew well over
    the orc's head. You missed.

    You died!

run:
  statement: |
    You run as quickly as possible, but the orc's
    speed is too great.

    What do you want to do?
  options:
    - text: Hide behind a boulder
      target: hide_behind_boulder

      target: town
  points: 5

sneak_out:
  statement: |
    As the orc enters the dark cave, you sliently sneak
    out. You're several feet away, but the orc turns around
    and sees you running.

    What do you do?
  options:
    - text: Lie down and hope for the best
      target: lie
    - text: Keep running
      target: run
  points: 5

town:
  statement: |
    While frantically running, you notice a rusted sword
    lying in the mud. You quickly reach down and grab it,
    but miss. You try to calm your heavy breathing as you
    hide behind a delapitated building, waiting for the orc
    to come charging around the corner. You notice a purple
    flower near your foot.

    Do you pick it up?
  options:
    - text: yes
      target: wait_with_flower
    - text: no
      target: wait_without_flower
  points: 10

wait_with_flower:
  statement: |
    The orc inevitably finds you. You quickly hold out the
    purple flower, somehow hoping it will stop him.
    It does! The orc was looking for love.

    This got weird, but you survived!
  points: 100

wait_without_flower:
  statement: |
    You hear its heavy footsteps and ready yourself for
    the impending orc.

    Maybe you should have picked up the flower.

    You died!
